The webpage is statically exported and hosted for free on Github pages.\\nBehind the scenes, for each of my projects the site is fetching the README.md markdown content from github. The markdown is sprinkled with a little bit of HTML and renders a user friendlier layout, using custom themed Material UI components.\\n\\nThe site doesnt run on a server. On the contrary it takes advantage of fast static hosting, and seamless page to page navigation because of Next.js & React.\\n\\n</InfoPaper>\\n\\n<InfoPaper>\\n<MyChip label=\\\"Typescript\\\"/>\\n<MyChip label=\\\"Javascript\\\"/>\\n<MyChip label=\\\"Next.js\\\"/>\\n<MyChip label=\\\"React 16.9\\\"/>\\n<MyChip label=\\\"Material-UI\\\"/>\\n<MyChip label=\\\"CSS-in-JS\\\"/>\\n<MyChip label=\\\"CSS\\\"/>\\n<MyChip label=\\\"HTML\\\"/>\\n<MyChip label=\\\"Markdown-to-jsx\\\"/>\\n<MyChip label=\\\"SSR\\\"/>\\n<MyChip label=\\\"Github API\\\"/>\\n<MyChip label=\\\"Github Pages\\\"/>\\n<MyChip label=\\\"Design Thinking\\\"/>\\n</InfoPaper>\\n\\n</InfoGrid>\\n\\n<PanelGrid>\\n<Panel id=\\\"1\\\" heading=\\\"What?\\\" secondaryHeading=\\\"About the technologies I used\\\" >\\n\\n### The Stack:\\n- Typescript\\n- Next.js\\n- React 16.9\\n- Webpack\\n- Markdown-to-JSX\\n- Css-in-JS\\n- Material-UI\\n</Panel>\\n\\n<Panel id=\\\"2\\\" heading=\\\"Why?\\\" secondaryHeading=\\\"About the choice of technologies\\\" >\\n\\n### Argumenting the stack\\nI coded this website in order to have a personal portfolio where I could show details about my projects, and also to do it in a way that displays my current skill's level. **My goal was to have a website that loads fast and feels fluid.** I also had a few more requirements:\\n\\n- I needed a link for each of my projects that I could share e.g. in my CV. Aka [deep-linking.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_linking)\\n- Responsive and User Friendly Design.\\n- No server costs and hassle.\\n- I also wanted to evolve my skills on the super popular React framework and to experiment with Typescript.\\n\\nI chose [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) as a framework (which kind of wraps around React), because I wanted to combine traits typical to Single Page Applications, like automatic code-splitting, dynamic imports, and page prefetching, and also to be able to export to static files so that I can host it cheap and serve it fast at the same time.\\n\\nRegarding the UI component library, I chose Material UI because, well it's based on solid and recongnisable design principles, it has great documentstion, supports Typescript development and is pretty easy to use and customise.\\n \\n</Panel>\\n\\n<Panel id=\\\"3\\\" heading=\\\"How?\\\" secondaryHeading=\\\"About my process\\\" >\\n\\n### Here there should be a \\\"diary\\\" of my process\\n\\n</Panel>\\n\\n<Panel id=\\\"4\\\" heading=\\\"For Devs\\\" secondaryHeading=\\\"Clone and install\\\" >\\n\\n## How to use\\n\\n**Note : npm6** is required to install dependencies properly.\\nDownload or clone the repo\\n\\n```sh\\ngit clone https://github.com/stefanosAgelastos/stefanosAgelastos.github.io\\ncd stefanosAgelastos.github.io\\n```\\n\\nInstall it and run:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm install\\nnpm run dev\\n```  \\n\\n</Panel>\\n\\n<Panel id=\\\"5\\\" heading=\\\"For Devs\\\" secondaryHeading=\\\"Make your own version of this site\\\" >\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nThese instructions here should be explaining which parts of the code you should change in order to host your own projects in development and production.
